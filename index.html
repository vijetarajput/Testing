        <h1>Croissant</h1>

        <p>When you think about a fresh, flaky croissant, you probably conjure up images of Paris. A lazy morning on the
            Left Bank,
            a small round table, reading Le Journal with a steamy cup of café au lait, and of course, that croissant.
            That
            warm,
            buttery croissant. Crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside. Enjoyable on all sides and in
            every
            way
            imaginable.

            Now, ask yourself where it’s from. Go deep. Go beyond the simple answer of “the little bakery around the
            corner”
            and
            search for the origin, the true birthplace of that oh-so-famous French delicacy.

            We’re sorry to do this to you, but we’re going to get right to it.

            That croissant you’re enjoying as you lovingly stare at the Tour Eiffel? It’s not French.</p>
